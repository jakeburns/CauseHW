    <h1 align = "center">My Cause: Computer Science</h1>
    <p align = "center">My cause is a passion for computer science and a hope for more people to learn and explore computer science.</p>
    <p>More people should learn how to code. In order to measure the current growth and widespreadness of computer science I looked at some data that shows counties in the united states and the amount of CS degrees awarded in that county</p>
    <p>I think this is a good measure of how widespread computer science is and where there are areas that should increase computer science learning.</p>
